# Contact-Tracing-with-ML

**Motivation:**
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, our lives were affected to a great extent – a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. And all that we could do then was to keep ourselves safe by not getting affected. It is when I started this project. This project is used to identify the contacts of the people who have tested positive for contagious diseases — such as COVID-19, measles and HIV. By doing so, we can reduce the number of people getting infected or speed up the treatment for infected people. With this, we can help in saving many lives. 

**Tools/technologies/methodologies:**
The dataset used for this project is a JSON file. After importing the necessary libraries and reading the dataset, data analysis is done by using scatter plot. Next, a model is created for contact tracing using DBSCAN algorithm with Machine Learning. DBSCAN is a density-based data clustering algorithm that groups data points in the given space. The DBSCAN algorithm groups data points close to each other and marks outlier data points as noise. With the model created, clusters are generated, which are used to identify infections by filtering the data in the clusters. On the function call with the person’s name as parameter, we get the infected people. Thus, we can say that a clustering algorithm like DBSCAN can perform data point clustering without prior knowledge of the datasets. 
The order of major steps that we perform in the project are as follows:
1.	Importing libraries and the data
2.	EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
3.	Defining the model
4.	Testing the model

**Skills gained (technical and otherwise):**
I was awed to see how we can use Machine Learning to help people in unprecedented times like the COVID-19 pandemic! I’ve learnt how to implement DBSCAN algorithm from this project. It was cool to plot the data in various ways like Scatter plot, Joint plot, and Box plot etc.

**Impact/obstacles:**
Well, from this project I’ve learnt how we can help people in our own way, during a pandemic. I’ve learnt that there’s no limit to learning and we can be helpful to people in almost all the situations, no matter how hard it is! This project also helped me to think of the solutions depending on the current situation. To implement this project to the real-world use case, data collection might be the hardest part.
